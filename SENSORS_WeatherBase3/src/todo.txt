things left to do:

-why is the time off by 1 hr???

-store mac address and device ID separately from sensors

-convert ip addresses to uint32_t

-fix espnow
    .should broadcast all server IP addresses (is there a maximum?) - could make this 25 bytes... IP0 IP1 IP2 IP3 then IP4 for next 21 servers (starting with master server IP)? YES
    .should it broadcast wifi credentials??? NO!
    .should multiple master servers be allowed? YES!

    

-BOOTSECURE 
  -should be a call to setup only.
  -should be a class that returns true or false only
  -if true, then this device and firmware match
  -if false, enter infinite loop
