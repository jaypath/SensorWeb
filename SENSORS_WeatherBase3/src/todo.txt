things left to do:

-fix espnow
    -should broadcast all server IP addresses (is there a maximum?) - could make this 25 bytes... IP0 IP1 IP2 IP3 then IP4 for next 21 servers (starting with master server IP)?
    -should it broadcast wifi credentials???
    -should multiple master servers be allowed?

-create firmware to store MAC address, wifi to preferences.h on initial start
    -this is separate firmware from this one
    
-fix preferences.h to read MAC address

-encrypt preferences.h
