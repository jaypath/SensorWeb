GPIO 2,4,5,12,13,14,15 support pullup and pulldown
  
  GPIO2 (often labeled as "D2" on development boards) - Supports both internal pull-up and pull-down resistors.
GPIO4 (often labeled as "D4" on development boards) - Supports both internal pull-up and pull-down resistors.
GPIO5 (often labeled as "D5" on development boards) - Supports both internal pull-up and pull-down resistors.

/* for ESP8266 12e
D0 is GPIO 16, and is used for wake. Does not support interrupt. must be pulled high (along with EN) at start. connect 16 to EN for low power state
D1 is GPIO5 and is SCL
D2 is GPIO4 and is SDA
D3 is GPIO0 and is connected to flash. It is pulled high internally, so should not be used as read (ok for output). if low will not boot
D4 is GPIO2 and is connected to LED. It is pulled high internally, so should not be used as read (ok for output). if low will not boot
D5 is gpio14 and is SCLK in spi
D6 is GPIO12 and is MISO
D7 is GPIO13 and is MOSI
D8 is GPIO15 and is pulled to GND. Can be used as CS, but will not boot if pulled high
