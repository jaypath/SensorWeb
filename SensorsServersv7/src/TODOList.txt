1. implement new time zone features. I stores DST info and UTC offset. Prefs only stores the time zone. remove time info from Prefs, which should only have immutable objects.
2. calibration ability needs to be completed (need the function in sensors)
3. implement plant database
4. Create a new NVS key pair for sensor parameters, which will not be encrypted. This will include all current data, plus calibration min/max.
